The Packet Processor coverage implementation provides comprehensive code and functional coverage for all aspects of the design. The coverage architecture ensures thorough verification while providing clear metrics for quality assessment and improvement.

The integration with the UVM environment enables automatic coverage collection and reporting, making it easy to track verification progress and identify areas needing additional testing. The coverage goals and automated checking provide clear targets for verification completeness.

With 19 comprehensive test scenarios covering all major functionality, the verification environment provides excellent coverage of:
- **Basic Operations**: Read, write, idle, and concurrent operations
- **FSM Behavior**: All state machine states and transitions
- **Protocol Compliance**: SOP/EOP packet protocol validation
- **Error Handling**: Overflow, underflow, and packet drop scenarios
- **Reset Behavior**: Async, sync, and dual reset scenarios
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and extreme scenarios

The coverage implementation supports both development and regression testing, ensuring that all design functionality is thoroughly verified and maintained throughout the development lifecycle.
