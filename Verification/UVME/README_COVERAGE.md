## üîß Coverage Groups

### 1. Basic Functional Coverage (`pkt_proc_cg`)

#### Operation Coverage
```systemverilog
basic_ops: coverpoint {enq_req, deq_req} {
    bins idle = {2'b00};
    bins write_only = {2'b10};
    bins read_only = {2'b01};
    bins concurrent = {2'b11};
}
```

**Coverage Points:**
- **Idle**: No operations
- **Write Only**: Write operations only
- **Read Only**: Read operations only
- **Concurrent**: Simultaneous read/write

#### Packet Protocol Coverage
```systemverilog
packet_protocol: coverpoint {in_sop, in_eop} {
    bins no_packet = {2'b00};
    bins start_packet = {2'b10};
    bins end_packet = {2'b01};
    bins single_word_packet = {2'b11};
}
```

**Coverage Points:**
- **No Packet**: No packet activity
- **Start Packet**: SOP asserted
- **End Packet**: EOP asserted
- **Single Word**: SOP and EOP in same cycle

#### Buffer Status Coverage
```systemverilog
buffer_status: coverpoint {pck_proc_full, pck_proc_empty, pck_proc_almost_full, pck_proc_almost_empty} {
    bins empty = {4'b0100};
    bins almost_empty = {4'b0001};
    bins normal = {4'b0000};
    bins almost_full = {4'b0010};
    bins full = {4'b1000};
    bins almost_empty_and_full = {4'b1001};
    bins almost_full_and_empty = {4'b0110};
}
```

**Coverage Points:**
- **Empty**: Buffer completely empty
- **Almost Empty**: Buffer near empty
- **Normal**: Normal buffer level
- **Almost Full**: Buffer near full
- **Full**: Buffer completely full

#### FSM Transitions
```systemverilog
write_state_transitions: coverpoint {write_state, enq_req, in_sop, in_eop} {
    bins idle_to_header = {6'b000010};  // idle + enq_req + in_sop
    bins header_to_data = {6'b010000};  // write_header + valid data
    bins data_to_idle = {6'b100001};    // write_data + in_eop

### Individual Coverage Goals
| Coverage Type | Goal | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| **Basic Coverage** | 90% | Functional operations and states |
| **FSM Coverage** | 95% | State machine transitions |
| **Protocol Coverage** | 85% | Packet protocol compliance |
| **Performance Coverage** | 80% | Throughput and utilization |
| **Edge Case Coverage** | 70% | Boundary conditions |

### Overall Coverage Goal
- **Target**: 85% overall coverage
- **Minimum**: 80% overall coverage
- **Excellence**: 90%+ overall coverage

## üîó Integration

### 1. Environment Integration
The coverage component is integrated into the UVM environment:

```systemverilog
class pkt_proc_env extends uvm_env;
    // Coverage component
    pkt_proc_coverage coverage;
    
    function void build_phase(uvm_phase phase);
        // Create coverage component
        coverage = pkt_proc_coverage::type_id::create("coverage", this);
    endfunction
    
    function void connect_phase(uvm_phase phase);
        // Connect agent to coverage
        pkt_proc_agent.agent_analysis_port.connect(coverage.cov_export);
    endfunction
endclass
```

### 2. Package Integration
The coverage file is included in the main package:

```systemverilog
package pkt_proc_pkg;
    // Include coverage
    `include "./../UVME/env/pkt_proc_coverage.sv"
endpackage
```

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Automatic Coverage Collection
Coverage is automatically collected during simulation:

```bash
# Run with coverage enabled
xrun -coverage all -f compile_list.f +UVM_TESTNAME=test_name

# View coverage report
imc -exec coverage.cmd
```

### 2. Coverage Reporting
Coverage reports are automatically generated:

```systemverilog
// Coverage report in report_phase
function void report_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    `uvm_info("COVERAGE", $sformatf("Basic Coverage: %0.2f%%", pkt_proc_cg.get_coverage()), UVM_LOW)
    `uvm_info("COVERAGE", $sformatf("FSM Coverage: %0.2f%%", fsm_state_cg.get_coverage()), UVM_LOW)
    `uvm_info("COVERAGE", $sformatf("Protocol Coverage: %0.2f%%", protocol_cg.get_coverage()), UVM_LOW)
    `uvm_info("COVERAGE", $sformatf("Performance Coverage: %0.2f%%", performance_cg.get_coverage()), UVM_LOW)
    `uvm_info("COVERAGE", $sformatf("Edge Case Coverage: %0.2f%%", edge_case_cg.get_coverage()), UVM_LOW)
endfunction
```

### 3. Coverage Goal Checking
Automated goal checking is available:

```systemverilog
// Check coverage goals
if (coverage.check_coverage_goals()) begin
    `uvm_info("COVERAGE", "All coverage goals met!", UVM_LOW)
end else begin
    `uvm_warning("COVERAGE", "Some coverage goals not met!")
end
```
